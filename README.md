# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Model on Vipas.AI

## Overview
Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness among working-age adults worldwide. With diabetes rates projected to rise sharply by 2045, early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss. However, regular screening remains a challenge due to limited access, awareness, and resources.

This AI-powered **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Model**, built using **EfficientNet**, leverages deep learning for accurate and early-stage identification of the disease. Deployed on **Vipas.AI**, this model offers a **scalable, accessible, and monetizable** AI solution for healthcare providers and researchers.
